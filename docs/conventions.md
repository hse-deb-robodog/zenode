# zenode conventions

Units, coordinate frames, time, and key naming: the part of a distributed
system that two teams get wrong independently, and that no type checker
catches because everything is `float`.

**Status: normative for `zenode.msgs` and for zenode-owned keys; advisory for
application contracts.** `zenode.msgs` complies today; new messages must.

zenode standardizes conventions, not topic keys. §7 explains why topic keys
are left out on purpose.

Where a rule matches ROS practice, the REP is cited. ROS compatibility is not a
goal in itself, but these conventions are proven, and the cost of differing is
paid at every integration.

## 1. Units

SI units on the wire, always, with no exception for values a human will read.

| Quantity | Unit | |
|---|---|---|
| Length | metre | m |
| Angle | **radian** | rad |
| Time | second | s |
| Linear velocity | metre/second | m/s |
| Angular velocity | **radian/second** | rad/s |
| Linear acceleration | metre/second² | m/s² |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Force / torque | newton, newton-metre | N, N·m |
| Voltage / current | volt, ampere | V, A |
| Temperature | **degree Celsius** | °C |
| Charge fraction (SoC) | **0.0–1.0**, not percent | — |

Follows REP-103, with two additions REP-103 does not cover: Celsius (kelvin is
correct SI and useless in a robot log) and state-of-charge as a fraction.

Degrees are a presentation format. They may appear in config files, CLI
output, and UIs; they are converted at that boundary and never travel in a
payload. A field named `*_deg` on a message is a bug. Units live in this
document, not in field names.

The same goes for percent: `soc: float = 0.87`, not `87`.

This covers `@metric` measurements too, which travel on a zenode-owned key and
are therefore normative here: `@metric("battery_soc", unit="1")` reports
0.0 to 1.0, an angle is radians and never named `*_deg`, and the `unit` field is
where the rule becomes visible to whoever reads the exported series.

## 2. Coordinate frames

Right-handed, everywhere. Positive rotation about an axis is counter-clockwise
when looking down that axis toward the origin.

Body frame: **FLU**, x **F**orward, y **L**eft, z **U**p.
World frame: **ENU**, x **E**ast, y **N**orth, z **U**p.

So on a ground robot: driving forward is `+x`, turning left is `+z` angular,
strafing left is `+y`. This matches REP-103, and it is why `Twist.angular.z` is
yaw rate and `Pose2D.theta` is yaw, both in radians and both counter-clockwise
positive.

Aerospace FRD/NED is the other defensible choice and is *not* used here. If you
integrate a component that speaks NED (many IMUs and flight controllers do),
convert it in the driver node. The conversion belongs at the hardware boundary,
not in every consumer.

Quaternions are **xyzw**, in that order, and unit length.

```python
Quaternion(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0, w=1.0)  # identity — the default
```

The `w`-last order matches ROS and Eigen's storage order; `w`-first matches
much of the aerospace and graphics literature. Both are common, and a mismatch
produces a rotation that looks *almost* correct. Never accept a quaternion
whose order you have not checked.

Producers normalize; consumers may assume normalized. A non-unit quaternion
on the wire is a producer bug. Consumers are not required to re-normalize
defensively, and messages carry no flag for it.

## 3. Frame names

`frame_id` is a plain string. The standard chain, per REP-105:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    map --> odom --> base_link
    base_link --> imu_link
    base_link --> lidar_link
    base_link --> camera_link
```

| Name | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `map` | World-fixed. Discontinuous: jumps when localization corrects. Accurate over the long term. |
| `odom` | World-fixed and continuous: never jumps, drifts without bound. |
| `base_link` | Rigidly attached to the robot body, at its rotation centre. |
| `<sensor>_link` | Rigidly attached to a sensor, e.g. `lidar_link`, `imu_link`. |

The `map`/`odom` split matters most: a control loop must consume `odom`
(continuous, so a localization correction cannot produce a step change in the
error term), while a goal or a map lookup must use `map`. Merging them into one
"pose" topic is the bug this naming exists to prevent.

zenode ships no transform tree. That is inside the scope fence: no TF, no
interpolation, no lookup graph. `Transform` carries `frame_id` and
`child_frame_id` so that a payload states what it is relative to; composing
transforms is the application's job.

## 4. Time and provenance

Time and provenance live in the `Envelope`. The spatial frame lives in the
payload.

`Envelope` already carries `node` (sender), `seq`, `ts_ns` (publish time), and
`traceparent`. A message therefore does not carry a ROS-style `Header`:

- No `stamp` field. Use `Envelope.ts_ns` / `Envelope.age_s()`.
- No `seq` field. Use `Envelope.seq`.
- Do carry `frame_id` when the payload is spatial. The transport cannot
  know it.

Two timestamps that can disagree are a debugging trap, and a payload `stamp`
eventually will disagree: a message constructed once and published twice
already does. `Transform` is the reference shape for a compliant spatial
message.

The exception is a payload whose timestamp is *not* its publish time:
a measurement captured at t₀ and published at t₁ after processing. Then a
payload field is correct, and it must be named for what it is
(`captured_ts_ns`), never `stamp`.

Two clocks, two purposes:

| | Clock | Used by | Breaks when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Envelope.ts_ns`, `age_s()`, `Topic.max_age` | wall (`time.time_ns`) | *Is this message too old to act on?* | hosts are not NTP-synced |
| Subscription `deadline` | monotonic (`loop.time`) | *Has anything arrived at all?* | never |

Wall clock is unavoidable for cross-host age, because a monotonic clock is
meaningless between machines. Anything measurable locally uses monotonic. See
`subscription-deadlines.md`.

## 5. Key naming

Keys are hierarchical, `/`-separated, lower `snake_case` segments, and
relative: the deployment namespace is prefixed at runtime, so the same
contract runs on N robots.

`node/` is reserved by zenode. It holds the runtime's own keys and an
application must not publish there:

| Key | Owner |
|---|---|
| `<ns>/node/<name>` | liveliness token (`presence.py`) |
| `<ns>/node/<name>/health` | `NodeHealth` heartbeat |
| `<ns>/node/<name>/info` | `NodeInfo` descriptor, latched |
| `<ns>/node/<name>/log` | `LogRecordMsg` records, for `zenode logs` |
| `<ns>/node/<name>/trace` | the hop-ring service, for `zenode trace` |

Everything outside `node/` belongs to the application. The suggested shape,
which zenode does not enforce and will not:

| Prefix | Contents |
|---|---|
| `command/` | Actuation requests. Usually `max_age`, rarely `latched`. |
| `state/` | What the robot currently is. Usually `latched`. |
| `sensors/` | Raw measurements. High rate, often `RawCodec`. |

Group by *kind*, not by producing node: `state/battery`, not `bms/battery`.
Node names change when code is refactored; the kind of data does not, and a key
that encodes its producer forces a wire-breaking rename every time you split a
node.

Keys owned by an outside system (a vendor driver, another stack) use
`Topic.absolute`, which bypasses the namespace:

```python
lidar = Topic.absolute("livox/lidar", bytes)  # RawCodec by default
```

## 6. What belongs in `zenode.msgs`

The admission criterion: the type must have a convention worth standardizing.
What matters is agreement, not how common the type is. The reason to
centralize a struct of three floats is that two teams will independently
disagree about its units, axis order, or frame semantics.

Applying it:

| Type | In | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Vector3`, `Quaternion`, `Pose`, `Pose2D`, `Twist`, `Transform` | ✅ shipped | Handedness, axis order, quaternion order |
| `NodeHealth` | ✅ shipped | zenode's own contract |
| `Odometry` | candidate | Which frame (§3) is exactly what people get wrong |
| `Imu` | candidate | Axis order and units are the whole content of REP-145 |
| `JointState` | candidate | By-name vs by-index ordering fails silently |
| `BatteryState` | candidate | SoC as fraction vs percent (§1) fails silently |
| `LaserScan` | ✗ | Beyond "radians and metres" there is nothing to agree on |
| Images, point clouds | ✗ | `bytes` + `RawCodec`; the codec choice dominates and no convention exists to encode |
| Robot commands, nav types, mission state | ✗ | Application domain. Belongs in its own contract, where it evolves with the robot |

Additional rules for anything admitted:

- No `Header` (§4).
- No covariance until a real consumer needs it. It triples the model, and
  JSON-serialising 36 floats per odometry message is measurable bandwidth.
- Every field defaulted, so a partially known message is constructible. The
  existing messages all do this.
- Compliance asserted in the module docstring, as `geometry.py` does:
  *"right-handed, SI units, quaternions in xyzw order"*.

## 7. What zenode deliberately does not standardize

Topic keys are not standardized. There is no `StandardTopics.cmd_vel`, and
there will not be.

A `Topic` binds key + schema + codec + `latched` + `max_age` + `trace`. Only the
schema is universal; the rest is deployment policy. `max_age=0.5` on a velocity
command is wrong for both a slow tracked vehicle and a drone.

The key string is the worst field to freeze. Changing a shipped key breaks the
wire silently: no exception, no type error, just two nodes that never hear each
other. A half-adopted standard misleads more than none.

ROS is the precedent: it ships `geometry_msgs/Twist` and has never shipped a
typed constant for `/cmd_vel`. Its interop value comes from REP-103 and
REP-105 (documents like this one) plus remapping at launch.

The consequence for reusable nodes: a node meant to run on more than one
robot takes its `Topic` as a constructor argument rather than importing a
global.

```python
class Teleop(Node):
    name = "teleop"

    def __init__(self, *, cmd_topic: Topic[Twist], **kw):
        super().__init__(**kw)
        self._cmd_topic = cmd_topic

    async def on_start(self) -> None:
        self.cmd = self.publisher(self._cmd_topic)
```

Such a node works on every deployment, and `harness.start_node(cls, **kwargs)`
passes the topic the same way, so it stays testable.

For a starting point, copy `examples/contract.py` rather than importing it.
Copying beats inheriting for deployment-specific declarations: no version
coupling, and keys get edited instead of silently inherited along with someone
else's `max_age`.

## 8. Changing a convention

Units, handedness, and quaternion order are wire-breaking and silent: a
consumer reading the old convention gets plausible numbers, not an error. So:

1. Do not change one to fix a single integration. Convert at that boundary.
2. If a change is genuinely warranted, it needs a message-level rename
   (`PoseV2`, or a new key), never an in-place redefinition. A field that means
   something different in 0.3 than in 0.2, under the same name, is undebuggable.
3. Key-naming and `zenode.msgs` admission (§5, §6) are soft and can be
   revised in a release note.
