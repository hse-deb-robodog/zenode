# Contracts

Reference for the typed contract: `Topic`, `Service`, `TopicSet`, codecs and
delivery semantics.

## Overview

A `Topic` binds four things in one declaration: the key, the payload type, the
wire format, and the delivery semantics. The publisher and the subscriber both
derive their behaviour from the same object, so a mismatch is a type error at
the call site rather than a parse failure in another process.

The contract is the only thing two nodes share. It normally lives in its own
module, importable by every node that speaks it.

## Topic

```python
CMD = Topic("command/cmd_vel", Twist, max_age=0.5)
```

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | — | Hierarchical key, relative to the deployment namespace. |
| `schema` | — | Payload type: a Pydantic model, or `bytes` for raw payloads. |
| `codec` | derived | Wire format. Defaults to Pydantic-JSON for models, octet-stream for `bytes`. |
| `latched` | `False` | Late joiners receive the last published value. |
| `history` | `1` | Samples retained for a latched topic. |
| `max_age` | `None` | Subscribers drop samples older than this many seconds. |
| `trace` | `False` | Publishing starts a trace. See [Observability](open-telemetry.md). |
| `trace_ratio` | `1.0` | Fraction of traces started here that are recorded. |
| `shm` | `False` | Publish through shared memory. See [Shared memory](shared-memory.md). |
| `priority` | `"data"` | Transmission priority band on a congested link. |
| `congestion_control` | `"drop"` | `"drop"` or `"block"` when the transmit queue is full. |
| `express` | `False` | Send immediately instead of batching. |
| `description` | `""` | Free text, shown by `zenode topics`. |

Invalid combinations raise `ContractError` at import time rather than failing
at runtime: an empty or whitespace-containing key, a non-positive `max_age`, a
`history` below 1, a `trace_ratio` outside 0 to 1, a `trace_ratio` on a topic
that is not a trace root, or an unknown `priority`/`congestion_control`.

### Keys and namespaces

Keys are relative. The deployment namespace is prefixed at runtime, so one
contract runs on many robots:

```toml
[transport]
namespace = "robodog"
```

`Topic("state/odometry", …)` then resolves to `robodog/state/odometry`. For
keys owned by an external system, opt out:

```python
LIDAR = Topic.absolute("livox/lidar", PointCloud)
```

### Delivery semantics

**`latched`** keeps the last value available to subscribers that join later.
Use it for state that changes occasionally and is always needed, such as a
battery level, a map version, or a mode. It requires HLC timestamping, which
zenode enables by default.

**`max_age`** drops samples older than a threshold. It compares the *sender's*
wall clock against the receiver's, so it requires synchronised clocks
(NTP/chrony): a sender skewed by more than `max_age` has everything it
publishes dropped. Drops are counted as `stale` and warned about.

`max_age` answers *is this message too old to act on?* It does not detect a
producer that stopped, because a message that never arrives is never checked.
For that, see [silence detection](nodes.md#silence-detection), which is
declared on the subscription rather than the topic.

### Quality of service

The three QoS parameters are fixed when the publisher is declared and apply to
every message on the topic. They only matter once a link is actually congested.
On an idle link all three are invisible.

**`priority`** picks a transmission band. Highest to lowest: `real_time`,
`interactive_high`, `interactive_low`, `data_high`, `data` (the default),
`data_low`, `background`. Zenoh drains higher bands first, so this is how a
control topic keeps precedence over bulk telemetry on the same link:

```python
CMD = Topic("command/cmd_vel", Twist, priority="real_time", max_age=0.5)
CAMERA = Topic("camera/rgb", bytes, codec=RawCodec(Encoding.IMAGE_JPEG),
               priority="data_low", shm=True)
```

Only the *relative* order matters: raising every topic to `real_time` changes
nothing. Reserve the higher bands for the topics that must outrank the rest.

zenode's own runtime traffic is already placed below application data. The
health heartbeat publishes at `data_low` and the log stream at `background`, so
a node that starts logging hard cannot push control messages off the link.

**`congestion_control`** decides what happens when the transmit queue is full.
The default `"drop"` discards the message, which is what you want for a stream
where the next sample supersedes this one, such as a pose at 30 Hz or a camera
frame. `"block"` waits for the queue to drain instead, for low-rate topics
where a lost message is a fault rather than a skipped frame.

> `"block"` blocks the calling thread, and `put()` normally runs on the node's
> event loop. A stalled link therefore stalls every timer, handler and signal
> handler in the process, the same failure [`Node.blocking`](nodes.md) exists
> to avoid. Use it on low-rate topics, and not from a handler that has to keep
> running regardless.

**`express`** sends each message on its own instead of batching it with
whatever else is queued, trading throughput for a little latency. It is worth
it for small, infrequent, latency-critical messages. On a high-rate stream it
is counterproductive, because batching is what keeps the per-message overhead
down.

`zenode topics` shows all three as flags when they differ from the default.

## Service

Request/reply over a zenoh queryable.

```python
GET_MAP = Service("nav/get_map", request=MapRequest, reply=CostMap)
```

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | — | Hierarchical key, relative to the namespace. |
| `request` / `reply` | — | Payload types. |
| `request_codec` / `reply_codec` | derived | Wire formats. |
| `description` | `""` | One line for humans, published on the node's descriptor. |
| `diagnostic` | `None` | `"read"`: callable by a diagnostic client as a side-effect-free data resource; needs a request with no fields (`zenode.msgs.Empty`). `"operation"`: an action, never reachable by GET. `None`: not exposed. |

A handler that raises produces a structured error reply, so the caller receives
a `ServiceError` carrying the message rather than a silent timeout. No server
produces `ServiceTimeout`.

`diagnostic` is how a service opts into the
[OpenSOVD sidecar](design/opensovd-adapter.md). The default is off: what a
robot shows a diagnostic client is decided here, in the contract, not in the
sidecar's configuration.

```python
GET_POSE = Service("state/get_pose", request=Empty, reply=Pose, diagnostic="read")
HOME = Service("motion/home", request=AxisId, reply=Ack, diagnostic="operation")
```

Services are for questions with answers: fetch a map, query a parameter, run a
calibration. A value that changes continuously belongs on a topic, where late
joiners and backpressure are handled.

## Codecs

| Codec | Used for |
|---|---|
| `PydanticJsonCodec` | Pydantic models. The default for a model `schema`. |
| `RawCodec(encoding)` | `bytes`. The default for a `bytes` schema, as octet-stream. |

`RawCodec` takes a zenoh `Encoding`, which is carried on the wire and lets
generic tools interpret the payload:

```python
CAMERA = Topic("camera/rgb", bytes, codec=RawCodec(Encoding.IMAGE_JPEG))
```

Payloads stay plain JSON or plain bytes. zenode's own delivery metadata
(sender, sequence number, timestamp, trace context) travels in a zenoh
*attachment* alongside, so any zenoh tool can read the payload without knowing
about zenode.

A custom codec is any object with `encode`, `decode` and `encoding`.

## TopicSet

Subclassing `TopicSet` registers the topics declared in it:

```python
class RobotTopics(TopicSet):
    cmd_vel = Topic("command/cmd_vel", Twist, max_age=0.5)
    odometry = Topic("state/odometry", OdometryState)
```

Registration is what makes the contract introspectable. `zenode topics` lists
it, `zenode echo` decodes payloads with the right type, and tests can assert
over it:

```python
for entry, topic in registered_topics("my_robot.contract"):
    assert topic.description, f"{entry.attr} needs a description"
```

The registry is process-global, so a process importing two contracts sees both.
Pass an owner prefix to filter to your own.

Topics do not have to live in a `TopicSet`. A plain module-level `Topic` works
everywhere except the registry-driven tooling.

## Standard messages

`zenode.msgs` is small by design:

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `msgs.geometry` | `Vector3`, `Quaternion`, `Pose`, `Pose2D`, `Twist`, `Transform` |
| `msgs.health` | `NodeHealth`, `NodeState` and the health key helpers |
| `msgs.log` | `LogRecordMsg` and the log key helpers |
| `msgs.trace` | `Hop`, `TraceQuery`, `TraceHops` and the trace key helpers |

Domain messages belong in your own contract package, where they can evolve with
the robot. See [Conventions](conventions.md) for units and frames.
