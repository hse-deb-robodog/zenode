"""The node runtime: lifecycle, wiring, and the process entry point.

A node subclasses :class:`Node`, declares its wiring, and is started with
:func:`run`::

    class Nav(Node):
        name = "nav"
        config: NavConfig                 # loaded from [node.nav] automatically

        cmd = publish(MotionTopics.move)  # typed Publisher once started

        async def tick(self) -> None:
            self.cmd.put(...)

    def cli() -> None:
        run(Nav)

The imperative equivalents (``self.subscribe(...)``, ``self.publisher(...)``,
``self.every(...)`` inside ``on_start``) remain for wiring only known at
runtime. ``run()`` owns the rest: config resolution, logging, session
bootstrap, the liveliness presence token, the health heartbeat, signal
handling, graceful teardown, and exit codes.
