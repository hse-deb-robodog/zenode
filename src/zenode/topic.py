"""The typed contract: topics and services.

A :class:`Topic` binds a key expression, a payload type, a codec, and
delivery semantics in one declaration. Publisher and subscriber sides both
derive their behavior from the same object, so a mismatch is a type error at
the call site instead of a runtime parse failure in another process.

Topics declared inside a :class:`TopicSet` subclass are collected into a
process-wide registry, which powers the CLI (``zenode topics``, typed
``zenode echo``) and any other introspection.

class Topic(Generic[T]):
    """One pub/sub channel of the contract.

    Args:
        key: Hierarchical key, relative to the deployment namespace. Use
            :meth:`Topic.absolute` for keys outside the namespace.
        schema: Payload type — a Pydantic model, or ``bytes`` for raw payloads.
        codec: Wire format. Defaults to Pydantic-JSON for models and raw
            octet-stream for ``bytes``.
        latched: Late joiners receive the last published value(s), via
            zenoh-ext advanced pub/sub.
        max_age: Subscribers drop samples older than this many seconds. Age
            compares the sender's wall clock against the receiver's, so it
            requires synchronized clocks (NTP/chrony); a sender skewed by more
            than ``max_age`` has every message dropped. Checked twice — on
            arrival (too old when it lands: not enqueued) and on dequeue (aged
            out while queued: not dispatched). Drops are counted (``stale``)
            and warned about, with a different message per stage.
        history: Number of samples kept/recovered for a latched topic.
        trace: Publishing on this topic starts a new trace that follows the
            data downstream (see :mod:`zenode.trace`). Set it on topics that
            begin a pipeline; an already-active trace is continued regardless.
        trace_ratio: Fraction of the traces started here that are *sampled* —
            recorded as spans by :mod:`zenode.otel`. Unsampled traces still
            carry an id, so log correlation keeps working at full rate; they
            just cost nothing to record. Use it on topics you cannot afford to
            record every message of: a 30 Hz camera at ``0.01`` gives ~0.3
            recorded traces a second.
        shm: Publish through shared memory (see :mod:`zenode.shm`). Worth it
            for frames and point clouds, pointless below a few tens of
            kilobytes. Requires ``[transport] shared_memory = true`` at both
            ends; falls back to a normal publish whenever that is not so.
        priority: Transmission priority band. Zenoh drains higher bands first
            when a link is congested, so this is how a control topic keeps
            precedence over bulk telemetry sharing the same link. Ordering only
            matters *relative* to the other topics on that link — moving
            everything up moves nothing.
        congestion_control: What to do when the transmission queue is full.
            ``"drop"`` (zenoh's default) discards the message, which is right
            for a stream where the next sample supersedes this one — a 30 Hz
            camera or pose. ``"block"`` waits for the queue to drain instead,
            for low-rate topics where a lost message is a fault rather than a
            skipped frame. **``"block"`` blocks the caller**, and ``put()``
            normally runs on the node's event loop, so a stalled link stalls
            every timer, handler and signal handler in the process — the same
            failure :meth:`Node.blocking` exists to avoid. Use it on low-rate
            topics only, and never from a handler that must keep running.
        express: Send each message on its own rather than batching it with
            whatever else is queued. Trades throughput and bandwidth for a
            little latency; worth it for small, infrequent, latency-critical
            messages, and actively harmful on a high-rate stream.
